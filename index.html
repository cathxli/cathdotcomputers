    <p>Hi, I'm Catherine. I am interested in human-computer interaction and
        anthropology. I spend time on computers, community, and culture; body,
        brain, and limits; access and abundance. I'm also a product designer.

        I like many things, and I like to learn about new things.

        I'm still setting this page up so it's a little bare.

        okay, ps: if anyone knows tips on how to write better (do I use too
        many "I"-starting sentences or what?) please share if you'd like! or you
        can draw a flower anything goes
